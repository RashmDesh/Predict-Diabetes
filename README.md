Predict Diabetes.ipynb ;- This file contain Diabetes datasets EDA and applyting ML.

diabetes_app.py:- This file contains Streamlite app code with diabetes prediction using kNN_Model.pkl

KNN_Model.pkl:-This is KNN  model which we are going to use for diabetes prediction.

ABOUT DATASET
In this dataset, the outcome used as the target class to predict that the Indians female is diabetic or not( 0=no diabetic and 1= diabetic)based on information about the patient such as blood pressure, body mass index (BMI), age,pregnancies etc.

Observation:
In diabetes datasets we have 768 rows and 9 columns.
Columns Details:-'Pregnancies', 'Glucose', 'BloodPressure', 'SkinThickness', 'Insulin','BMI', 'DiabetesPedigreeFunction', 'Age', 'Outcome'.
There is non null values in datasets.
There are 9 numberical columns with 6 int64 types and 2 are folat type.
